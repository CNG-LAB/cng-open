This is the public GitHub repository for the Cognitive Neurogenetics lab. We are affiliated to Max Planck Insitute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig https://www.cbs.mpg.de/independent-research-groups/cognitive-neurogenetics, Germany & the Insititute for Neuroscience and Medicine Brian and Behaviour (INM-7) at Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich, Germany https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/inm/inm-7/research-groups/cognitive-neurogenetics.

See our labsite here: https://cng-lab.github.io/.

In this repository you can find some of the chief code that we use for our research projects, shared openly so it can be used interoperably. You can check the collaborators personal GitHub pages as well, they may be more up to date.
