Here you can find the data that was used and generated for the manuscript „COORDINATED CORTICAL THICKNESS ALTERATIONS ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS: A TRANSDIAGNOSTIC ENIGMA STUDY“



Data that was generated for this study:
-Cohen’s_d_CT_6_disorders.mat = ENIGMA case-control difference Cohen’s d maps for cortical thickness.
- Disorder_covariance.mat = Cross-disorder inter-parcel correlation of COhen’s d values
- Normative_Connectivity_Hubs.mat = Hubs computed based on HCP young adult sample (rs-fMRI and DTI)
- Transdiagnostic_Covariance_Hubs.mat = Cross-disorder hubs of covariance of CT alterations
- Epicenters.mat = All cortical and sub-cortical functional and structural disease epicenters
- CT_psych_gradients.mat = the transdiagnostic gradients presented in this manuscript
- Cyto_gradients.mat = The 2 trans diagnostic gradients stratified according to Von Economo-Koskinas cytoarchitectonic classes
- Genes_G1.mat = Genes whose cortical expression pattern significantly correlates with G1

Data that is required to run the analyses
- Valk2020_CT_structural_covariance_gradient.mat = normative Gradient of cortical thickness covariance, published by Sofie Valk in Science Advances 2020
- neurosynth_z_values = Functional topic terms and their fMRI correlates (maps)
- DK_midbrain_parcels.mat / midbrain_vertices_fsa5.mat = vertices which you can set to 0 during visualization to mask the midbrain
