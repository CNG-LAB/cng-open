## Dynamic change in adolescent resilience and vulnerability to environmental adversity links to cortical myelination trajectories
# This repository contains scripts and data to reproduce analyses:

# ScrFun: 
**distress_prediction.ypnb** -> Generates resilience scores by predicting well-being / distress from adversity measures
    main output: resilience_scores_prediction.csv; resilience_scores_prediction_repeated_measures.csv —> for multiple time points (use this)
**MT_delta_Figures_1_2.m** —> computes change in MT and FC and relation to change in resilience score, generates Figures 1&2.
**Maturational_Index_Gradients_Figures_3_4.m** —> computes MPC and FC maturational indices, compares groups of individuals showing an increase vs. decrease in resilience capacities, and compares this group difference to nullmodels of random/permuted groups. Generates FIgures 3 and 4.
